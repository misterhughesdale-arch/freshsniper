## ⚠️ Known Issues

### Issue 1: Buy Transactions Failing Since Recent Commits

**Status**: CRITICAL  
**Symptoms**:

- Simulations failing with `Custom:1` error
- "ATA already exists" or "insufficient funds"
- Was working at commit `1ccb5fe` with 120+ confirmed txs
- Broken after adding filters/changes

**Root Cause**: Unknown - need to diff exact changes

**Workaround**: Revert to commit `1ccb5fe` for working buys

### Issue 2: Sell Account Order Confusion

**Status**: FIXED (commit 98fac10)  
**Solution**:

- Position 9: creator_vault
- Position 10: token_program
- 14 accounts total (no volume tracking)

## 🏗️ Architecture Decisions

### Monorepo Structure

✅ **Working Well**:

- pnpm workspaces for clean dependency graph
- Packages properly isolated
- TypeScript project references working
- Clear separation of concerns

### Configuration Strategy

✅ **Working Well**:

- TOML for human-readable config
- Environment variable interpolation `${VAR}`
- Zod validation catches errors early
- Multi-environment support

### Transaction Pipeline

✅ **Working**:

- Buy: 16 accounts, 25 bytes instruction data
- Sell: 14 accounts, 25 bytes instruction data
- Both with `track_volume` byte (Option::None)
- Creator fetched from bonding curve state

⚠️ **Issues**:

- Recent commits broke something
- Need to identify exact breaking change
- Simulations failing with `Custom:1`

### Sell Manager Architecture

✅ **Excellent Design**:

- Completely decoupled from buy loop
- Uses Geyser wallet filtering
- No shared state needed
- Auto-detects positions from stream
- Timer + activity-based selling

---

## 📈 Development Progress

### Session 1 (Hours 1-2): Foundation

- ✅ Monorepo setup
- ✅ Config system with Zod
- ✅ Core packages (logging, metrics, events)
- ✅ Initial transaction builders

### Session 2 (Hours 3-4): Integration

- ✅ Real Geyser stream (105+ tokens)
- ✅ Jito integration
- ✅ Buy transactions WORKING (120+ confirmed)
- ⚠️  Debugging account order

### Session 3 (Hour 5): Sell System

- ✅ Auto-sell manager package
- ✅ Sell transaction builder (14 accounts)
- ✅ Separate sell-manager service
- ✅ 6 recovery/utility scripts
- ⚠️  Buy transactions broke (unknown cause)

---

## 🎓 Key Learnings

### What Worked

1. **Follow the IDL exactly** - Account order matters
2. **Test incrementally** - Stream-only mode validated architecture
3. **Use environment variables** - No hardcoding enables flexibility
4. **Separate concerns** - Buy and sell as independent services
5. **Batch operations** - 3 sells per tx saves 60% on fees

### What Didn't Work

1. **Changing working code** - Broke buy transactions
2. **Assuming sell = buy** - Different account orders
3. **Over-engineering** - Simple wallet filter > complex state management

### Critical Discoveries

1. **track_volume byte** - 25 bytes total, not 24
2. **creator_vault position** - Different in buy vs sell
3. **Wallet filtering** - Geyser can filter by ANY pubkey
4. **Graduated tokens** - No bonding curve when migrated to Raydium

---

## 🚀 Deployment Architecture

### Recommended Setup

**Process 1**: Buy Loop

```bash
pnpm dev:full
```

- Detects new tokens
- Buys immediately
- Logs to `logs/buy-loop.log`

**Process 2**: Sell Manager

```bash
pnpm sell:manager
```

- Monitors wallet transactions
- Auto-sells on activity/timer
- Logs to `logs/sell-manager.log`

**Process 3**: Recovery (As Needed)

```bash
pnpm recovery:bulk    # Fast batch recovery
pnpm info:positions   # Check holdings
```

### Infrastructure Requirements

- **RPC**: Helius/Shyft with high rate limits
- **Geyser**: Shyft Yellowstone gRPC (real-time)
- **Jito**: Block Engine access (MEV protection)
- **SOL**: ~0.5 SOL for gas fees and priority

---

## 📊 Current Capabilities

### Working Now

- ✅ Stream detection (1500+ tokens proven)
- ✅ Buy transactions (120+ confirmed)
- ✅ Sell transactions (multiple confirmed)
- ✅ Bulk recovery (6 tokens sold successfully)
- ✅ Auto-sell service (ready for field testing)

### Needs Testing

- ⏳ Buy loop (broken since recent commits - need to fix)
- ⏳ Sell manager in production
- ⏳ End-to-end buy → hold → sell cycle

### Not Yet Implemented

- ❌ Liquidity filters
- ❌ Creator whitelist/blacklist
- ❌ Advanced strategies (TP/SL with price tracking)
- ❌ Web dashboard
- ❌ Multi-wallet support

---

## 🔧 Technical Debt

### High Priority

1. **Fix buy transactions** - Something broke since commit 1ccb5fe
2. **Test sell-manager** - Needs live buy → sell cycle validation
3. **Add error recovery** - Graceful handling of RPC failures

### Medium Priority

1. **Add filters** - Min liquidity, creator lists
2. **Improve logging** - Per-service log files
3. **Add monitoring** - Health checks, metrics export

### Low Priority

1. **Database integration** - Replace in-memory store
2. **Web dashboard** - Real-time position monitoring
3. **Multi-strategy support** - Configurable exit strategies

---

## 📈 Performance Analysis

### Strengths

- ✅ **Sub-millisecond detection** - Geyser is incredibly fast
- ✅ **Efficient transactions** - 85-100k compute units
- ✅ **Jito integration** - Better landing rates than public mempool
- ✅ **Batch operations** - Recovery scripts optimize for fees

### Bottlenecks

- ⚠️  **Jito rate limits** - 1 tx/second on free tier
- ⚠️  **RPC latency** - Bonding curve fetches add 300-500ms
- ⚠️  **Simulation overhead** - Pre-flight checks add latency

### Optimization Opportunities

1. **Cache bonding curve states** - Reduce RPC calls
2. **Skip simulation** - Use skipPreflight for speed
3. **Bundle submissions** - Jito bundles for guaranteed ordering
4. **Parallel processing** - Multiple buy bots with different wallets

---

## 🎯 Production Readiness

### Ready for Production ✅

- Configuration management
- Logging and metrics
- Error handling
- Documentation
- Recovery tools
- Sell automation

### Needs Work Before Production ⚠️

- Fix buy transaction issues (regression)
- Add liquidity filters (prevent rug pulls)
- Field test sell-manager (24-hour run)
- Set up monitoring/alerts
- Test with production RPC limits

### Future Enhancements 🔮

- Real-time PnL dashboard
- Multi-wallet orchestration
- Advanced strategies (TP/SL with price tracking)
- Telegram notifications
- Bundle submissions for MEV

---

## 💰 Economic Analysis

### Transaction Costs (Per Token)

- **Buy**: ~0.000005 SOL (5k lamports base) + priority fee
- **Sell**: ~0.000005 SOL + priority fee
- **Priority Fee**: 0.0001-0.01 SOL depending on competition
- **Total per trade**: ~0.001-0.02 SOL

### Recovery Economics

- **ATA Rent**: 0.00203 SOL per token
- **142 tokens** = 0.29 SOL recoverable
- **Bulk recovery saved**: ~0.19 SOL (60% fee reduction)

### Profitability Threshold

For 0.1 SOL buys:

- Need >2% gain to break even (covers fees)
- Need >10% gain for worthwhile trades
- Exit strategy critical for profitability
